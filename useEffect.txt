Always called after the first initial render 

maybe called after the first render based on the 2nd param 
we pass after the => func

1. [] -> never gets called again 

2. no param -> call after every single rerender 

3. [attributes(eg: counter)] -> called after the rerender IF there is a change in that attribute 

                                if mo change in attri , then it wont run
